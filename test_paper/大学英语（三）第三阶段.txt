 2. Setting up time schedule （计划）is one of the keys to success in and out of school. 
To begin organizing your time, you must 1 list those activities not connected 
27 school—eating, playing, exercising, and sleeping. Taking the schedule 3consideration, 
you should then include those hours 4you are attending class. Where possible, 
you should fill5your class throughout the day in order that you can study 
between classes. On this same schedule, you should clearly mark those hours for 
study and faithfully study during those 6. You must decide how many hours are 
needed to 7the course material. Finally, long-term projects like reading a long 
novel or writing a 8 should be placed on a monthly calendar （日历） so that you are 
frequently made 9of how much time is still left.  Becoming a successful student 
also requires 10well-thought-out strategies （策略）. First, you should set up class 
priorities(轻重缓急) to determine which courses are most important to you.  11this 
priority list you should think of the grade that you wish to 12for each course 
by the end of the semester. You should study for those important courses when your 
13is clearest.  14all times, your study hours should be concentrated 15, interrupted 
only by an occasional （偶尔）16. When you work on longer projects, you should 
devise efficient strategies to complete them, dividing them 17smaller tasks 
and setting a time 18for each. 19 , you should try to develop an efficient study 
area—one that provides you 20all the necessary study materials and allows you time 
to concentrate without interruption.

 1. In the United States elementary education begins at the age of six. At this stage 
nearly all the teachers are women, mostly married. The atmosphere is usually 
very friendly , and the teachers have now accepted the idea that the important 
thing is to make the children happy and interested. The old authoritarian (要绝对服从的) 
methods of education were discredited (不被认可) rather a long time ago--so much 
so that many people now think that they have gone too far in the direction of trying 
to make children happy and interested rather than giving them actual instruction.The 
social education of young children tries to make them accept the idea 
that human beings in a society need to work together for their common good. So 
the emphasis is on co-operation rather than competition throughout most of this 
process. This may seem curious, in view of the fact that American society is highly 
competitive; however, the need for making people sociable in this sense has 
come to be regarded as one of the functions of education. Most Americans do grow 
up with competitive ideas, and obviously quite a few as criminals, but it is not 
fair to say that the educational system fails. It probably does succeed in making 
most people sociable and ready to help one another both in material ways and 
through kindness and friendliness.  
 (1) (4分)According to the passage, the U.S. 
elementary education is supposed to make children _____. 
A. sensible and sensitive
