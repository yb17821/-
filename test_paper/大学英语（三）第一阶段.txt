 1. Have you 1asked yourself why children go to school? You will probably say that 
they go 2their own language and other languages, arithmetic, history, science 
and 3subjects. That is quite true; but why do they learn these things? And are these 
things 4that they learn at school?We 5our children to school to 6them for the 
time 7 they will be big and will have to work 8themselves. Nearly all they study 
at school has some   9use in their life, but is that the only reason 10 they 
go to school?There is 11 in education than just learning facts. We go to school 12  all 
to learn how to learn, 13when we have 14school we can continue to learn. 
A man who really knows  15will always be successful , because 16he has to do something 
new which he has never had to do 17, he will rapidly teach himself how 
to do it in the best 18 . The uneducated person, 19, is probably unable to do something 
new, or does it badly. The purpose of schools, therefore, is not just to 
teach languages, arithmetic, etc.,  20to teach pupils the way to learn.

 1. Ever since humans have inhabited the earth, they have made use of various forms 
of communication. Generally, this expression of thoughts and feelings has been 
in the form of oral speech. When there is a language barrier, communication is 
accomplished through sign language in which motions stand for letters, words and 
ideas. Tourists, the deaf, and the mute have had to resort to this form of expression. 
Many of these symbols of whole words are very picturesque and exact and 
can be used internationally; spelling, however, cannot. Body language transmits 
ideas or thoughts by certain actions, either intentionally or unintentionally.. 
A wink can be a way of flirting or indicating that the party is only joking. A 
nod signifies approval, while shaking the head indicates a negative reaction. Other 
forms of nonlinguistic language can be found in Braille ( a system of raised 
dots read with the fingertips), signal flags, ,Morse code, and smoke signals. Road 
maps and picture signs also guide, warn, and instruct people. While verbalization 
is the most common form of language, other systems and techniques also express 
human thoughts and feelings.

 2. College brings together people from all walks of life. There are so many different 
types of people in the world but if you go to a college campus, you are sure 
to find at least one of every kind. The great part about being here with so many 
different people is that you get to interact with some interesting characters 
and see how to deal with them. You will meet the people you dread the most, the 
smart –ass, the brain, or the unique spirit, but no matter who it is that is your 
worst nightmare to be around you will always be paired up with them in a group 
project. When you get into the real world you are not going to be able to pick 
your boss or coworkers. Interacting with these people in college and living with 
different roommates will help you learn how to cooperate with the people in life 
you find so unpleasant. College life is fun. The fact that I have been here 
for a short time just means it has not yet been a life changing experience to me. 
If I were to give any tips on how to survive, it would not be how to survive college, 
but how to survive life. I would have to say that one should be outgoing 
and live life to the fullest. Meet new people whenever you can because they just 
may be a major influence in your life. Also, get your work done before you go 
out and party. Lastly, I would have to say, in life if you ever feel lost or alone, 
talk to someone about it. Everyone gets depressed at times in their life and 
there is always someone who will listen to your problems.

 2. Our family is trying to decide where to go for our vacation this summer. Our 
son, Tom, wants to go to Yellow Stone Park again to see the bears. We did that last 
summer and what an experience it was! When we got there, we put up our tent 
and went to explore. As we returned, we heard our daughter Susie cry out and then 
we saw a bear enter our camp. Tom wanted his father to chase him away. His father 
said, "No, it's dangerous to chase a bear, and don't let him chase you!" Susie 
said"What shall we do? Maybe we ought to climb a tree." Tom said, "No, we've 
got to get him out of there. He might go to sleep in our tent." "Maybe we could 
make him leave if we put some honey outside for him to eat." Susie suggested. Then 
I said, "How are you going to get the honey? It's in the tent." We watched the 
bear enter the tent and heard him upset everything inside. "It's foolish for us 
to try to catch him," said my husband, "leave him alone and wait for him to come 
out." We waited, but the bear stayed inside. We had to sleep in the car.
