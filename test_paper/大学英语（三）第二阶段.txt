is. Space also tells something about a person's __15__ towards others.Dr.

 2. ou have been badly injured in a car accident. It is necessary to give you a blood 
transfusion because you lost a great deal of blood in the accident. However, 
special care should be taken in selecting new blood for you. If the blood is too 
different from your own , the transfusion could kill you. There are four basic 
types of blood: A, B, AB, and O. A simple test can indicate a person’s blood type, 
which, like hair and height, is inherited from parents. Because of substances 
contained in each type, the four groups must be transfused carefully. Basically, 
A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or 

B. O can give to any other group; hence it is often called the universal donor. 
For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient. However, 
because so many reactions can occur in transfusions, patients usually receive 
only salt or plasm
A.liqui
D.until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible 
in the blood bank of a hospital. In his way, it is possible to avoid any bad 
reactions to the transfusion. There is a relationship between your blood type 
and your nationality. Among Europeans and people of European ancestry, about 42 
percent have type A while 45 percent have type O. The rarest is type A
B. Other 
races have different percentages. For example, some American Indian groups have 
nearly 100 percent type O.

A. Getting Blood and Plasma

transfusion, it is easiest to find the acceptable type of blood for a person

C. AB 
D. O  
答案 C 
 (4) (4分)The purpose 
of using salt and plasma before a blood transfusion is to allow time________. 

A. to test the reactions to the transfusion 
B. for matching the blood to 
be transfused with the patient’s blood. 
C. for the blood to be delivered from the 
blood bank

 2. Nonverbal (非语言的) communication has to do with gestures, movements and closeness 
of two people when they are talking. The scientists say that those gestures, 
movements and so on have meaning which words do not carry.For example, the body 
distance between two speakers can be important. North Americans often complain that 
South Americans are unfriendly because they tend to stand close to the North 
American when speaking, while the South American often considers the North American 
to be “cold” or “distant” because he keeps a greater distance between himself 
and the person he is speaking to . The “eye contact” provides another example 
of what we are calling nonverbal communication. Scientists have observed that there 
is more eye contact between people who like each other than there is between 
people who don’t like each other. The length of time that the person whom you 
are speaking to looks at your eyes indicates the amount of interest he has in the 
things you are talking about.On the other hand, too long a gaze can make people 
uncomfortable. The eyes apparently play a great part in nonverbal communication. 
Genuine warmth or interest, shyness or confidence can often be seen in the eyes. 
We do not always consider a smile to be a sign of friendliness. Someone who 
is always smiling, and with little apparent reasons, often makes us uneasy.

 1. My husband had just bought a new washing machine for me. I decided to use it 
and I washed a lot of things.Everything worked well, but I found one of my husband's 
socks missing. I looked everywhere for it, but I couldn't find it anywhere. 
The next morning, I got ready for school as usual. When the bell rang, the students 
came in. I greeted them first and then told them what we were going to do that 
day. When I turned around to write on the blackboard, the class broke out a 
roar! They laughed and laughed. They laughed so much, in fact, that I was afraid 
the headmaster would be into seeing all this. I asked the class to stop, but the 
more I talked, the more they laughed. I decided to pay no attention to them and 
I continued to write on the blackboard. When I did this, they roared even more.Finally, 
the teacher who had the room next to mine came in to see what all the 
laughter was about. When he came in, he started laughing, too! "Good heavens," I 
said. "Will someone please tell me what is so funny?" "Oh, God," said the teacher. 
"You have a brown sock to the back of your skirt!" So that's how I found my 
husband's missing sock. "Oh, well," I said to the class. "Let's just say you have 
had an unforgettable lesson on static (静止的) electricity."
