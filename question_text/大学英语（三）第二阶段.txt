It is necessary to give you a blood transfusion because you lost a great deal of blood in the accident. However, special care should be taken in selecting new blood for you. If the blood is too different from your own , the transfusion could kill you. There are four basic types of blood: A, B, AB, and O. A simple test can indicate a person’s blood type, which, like hair and height, is inherited from parents. Because of substances contained in each type, the four groups must be transfused carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can give to any other group; hence it is often called the universal donor. For the opposite reason, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient. However, because so many reactions can occur in transfusions, patients usually receive only salt or plasmA.liquiD.until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible in the blood bank of a hospital. In his way, it is possible to avoid any bad reactions to the transfusion. There is a relationship between your blood type and your nationality. Among Europeans and people of European ancestry, about 42 percent have type A while 45 percent have type O. The rarest is type AB. Other races have different percentages. For example, some American Indian groups have nearly 100 percent type O. 纠错 \n (1) (4分)A good title for this passage is__________ A. Getting Blood and Plasma B. Special Blood Types C.

Nonverbal (非语言的) communication has to do with gestures, movements and closeness of two people when they are talking. The scientists say that those gestures, movements and so on have meaning which words do not carry.For example, the body distance between two speakers can be important. North Americans often complain that South Americans are unfriendly because they tend to stand close to the North American when speaking, while the South American often considers the North American to be “cold” or “distant” because he keeps a greater distance between himself and the person he is speaking to . The “eye contact” provides another example of what we are calling nonverbal communication. Scientists have observed that there is more eye contact between people who like each other than there is between people who don’t like each other. The length of time that the person whom you are speaking to looks at your eyes indicates the amount of interest he has in the things you are talking about.On the other hand, too long a gaze can make people uncomfortable. The eyes apparently play a great part in nonverbal communication. Genuine warmth or interest, shyness or confidence can often be seen in the eyes. We do not always consider a smile to be a sign of friendliness. Someone who is always smiling, and with little apparent reasons, often makes us uneasy. 纠错 \n (1) (4分)According to the passage, nonverbal communication _____.
